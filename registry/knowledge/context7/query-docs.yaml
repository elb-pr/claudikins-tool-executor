  Retrieves and queries up-to-date documentation and code examples from Context7 for any programming library or
  framework.


  You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool,
  UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their
  query.


  IMPORTANT: Do not call this tool more than 3 times per question. If you cannot find what you need after 3 calls, use
  the best information you have.

        Exact Context7-compatible library ID (e.g., '/mongodb/docs', '/vercel/next.js', '/supabase/supabase',
        '/vercel/next.js/v14.3.0-canary.87') retrieved from 'resolve-library-id' or directly from user query in the
        format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version'.
    query:

        The question or task you need help with. Be specific and include relevant details. Good: 'How to set up
        authentication with JWT in Express.js' or 'React useEffect cleanup function examples'. Bad: 'auth' or 'hooks'.
        IMPORTANT: Do not include any sensitive or confidential information such as API keys, passwords, credentials, or
        personal data in your query.
